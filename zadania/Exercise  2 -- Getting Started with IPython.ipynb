    "Once you've revealed the menu, choose the option called **User Interface Tour**. IPython will take you on a short, guided tour of the user interface you are currently using. This will probably only take you a few minutes, but it is super helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two other options on the **Help** menu are worth pointing out. First is a link to the complete IPython documentation, listed as **IPython Help**. Second is a quick cheat-sheet of keyboard shortcuts, listed as **Keyboard Shortcuts**. Spend a little time here, and you will be able to navigate around the tool without ever touching the mouse. Keyboard shortcuts are the way true programmers move like ninjas around their programs."

    "\n",
    "Other cells contain Python code. These are called Code cells, and you can tell them apart from other cells because they have words like **``In [ ]``** to the left. This indicates that the cell is *input* to IPython, and it can be run. If the cell has been run, the brackets will contain a number showing the step when the code was run. The first cell to be run will be given the number **1**, the second will be given the number **2**, and so on. If you re-run the same cell over again, its step number will be updated to show the latest number. If the code in the cell takes a while to run, the brackets will be filled with an asterisk ('** * **') to show you that it is still going.\n",

    "One of the key features of the IPython environment is that it supports what's called a REPL environment:\n",

    "* **E** for Evaluate\n",
    "* **P** for Print\n",
    "* **L** for Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that when you execute a code block (pressing the \"play\" button), IPython **reads** what you've entered, tries to **evaluate** it and run it as Python code, **prints** the results for you to see, and **loops**, or waits for you to do the same thing again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing is that each cycle through the REPL loop happens in the same Python environment, so things you set or changed in one REPL loop are still available the next time you execute it. So if you set a variable, or import some libraries, they are still available in the next loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easy to experiment with code. You can run it, see what happens, change it, run it again, add onto it to make it do more stuff, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many experienced programmers build programs piece-by-piece. They start with something very simple, and keep adding onto it, one bit at a time, until they are done. The REPL environment is a great way to do this."
